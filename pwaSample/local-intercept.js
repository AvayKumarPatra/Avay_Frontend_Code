 * Custom interceptors for the project.

 *            "intercept": "./local-intercept.js"

 * as the very last intercept to run.
 *
 * A project can intercept targets from any of its dependencies. In a project
 * with many customizations, this function would tap those targets and add
 * or modify functionality from its dependencies.
